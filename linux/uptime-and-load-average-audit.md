> **Company:** Microsoft | **Difficulty:** Easy

---

#### **Scenario**

A Linux server is under review for stability and recent performance evaluation.

#### **Task**

Use the `uptime` command to determine how long the server has been running and extract the 15-minute load average as a floating-point number (e.g., 0.45). Save the uptime to `/home/devops/uptime.txt` and the 15-minute load average to `/home/devops/loadavg.txt`.

#### **Example**
```
Contents of `/home/devops/uptime.txt`: `2 days, 5:37`

Contents of `/home/devops/loadavg.txt`: `0.45`
```
