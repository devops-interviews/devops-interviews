# Rebase Branch with Reversed Commit Order

> **Company:** Booking.com | **Difficulty:** Easy

---

#### Scenario:

You have a Git repository at `/home/interview/repo` where your `feature-refactor` branch has four commits in the wrong logical order. The commits should be reversed (oldest to newest becomes newest to oldest) to make more sense for code review. You need to rebase this branch onto the latest `main` branch while reversing the commit order.

#### Task:

Navigate to `/home/interview/repo`, rebase `feature-refactor` onto `main` while reversing all commits using interactive rebase, and verify the commits appear in the correct reversed sequence with all changes preserved.
